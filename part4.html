            <p>I like to eat, quite a bit. I also enjoy creating video games, and <b>all around fun.</b></p>
                <hr /><br />
            <p>My career goals are to make games professionally. <u>But I wouldn't mind</u> working at <i>Google/Microsoft/Intel/Apple</i> <abbr title="ectcetera">etc</abbr>.</p>

            <p>I have 3 dogs that are very dear to me. Raven, a terrier mix, is a pint sized guard dog. Titan is a purebred chocolate labrador bafoon. He is a derpasaurous rex. My baby is <dfn>Jax</dfn>, he's a chiuaua-terrier mix. 
            <blockquote>He is a <s>spoiled brat</s><u>saint</u> that would be the equivalent to a pokemon, if i were Ash.</blockquote> <sup>Oh and I have 2 brothers.</sup></p>

            <p>I rock a mullet because its <em>business</em> in the front, party in the back. It's like I'm formal, but I'm here to party. </p>
